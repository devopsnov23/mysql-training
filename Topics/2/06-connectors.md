## Connectors and APIs 

### MySQL Connectors 
* Connector/C - Provides a client library for C development and is used for C applications.
* Connector/C++ - Allows C++ applications to connect to MySQL.
* Connector/J - Implements the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API which allows Java applications to connect to MySQL.
* Connector/NET - Allows .NET applications to connect to MySQL. These applications can be written in any .NET supported language.
* Connector/ODBC - Provides support for connecting to MySQL through the Open Database Connective (ODBC) API.
* Connector/Python - Allows Python applications to connect to MySQL using a Python DB version 2.0 compliant API.

### MySQL APIs 
* CAPI- Provides access to MySQL from C.
* PHP API - Provides access to MySQL from PHP. There are three API extensions available in PHP mysqli PDO_MYSQL and mysql_xdevapi
* Perl API - Provides access to MySQL from Perl. This requires the DBI module to be installed which provides a generic interface to access the database, as well as the Database Driver (DBD) module, DBD::mysql
* Python API - Provides access to MySQL from Python. A third party driver, mySQLdb, may be used to provide MySQL support. Alternatively, the MySQL Connector/Python can be used as it provides an interface to the same Python API. Oracle also 
supports this connector.
* Ruby API - Provides access to MySQL from Ruby. Two APIs are available, the MySQL/Ruby API which is based on the libmysqlclient library, and the 
Ruby/MySQL API which is written to use the native MySQL network protocol.
